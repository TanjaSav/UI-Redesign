Redesign
-----
I redesigned two pages from the website italia.is.

I surrounded important elements with white space and paid attention to alignment. 
All elements on the page are positioned to start and are aligned to each other both horizontally and vertically. 
I organized elements and eliminated the unnecessary.

The main color of the Website was dark, so I decided to update it and gave everything a fresher look.
I switched the main background image to more open image and added the title.
I tweaked the contrast, found the new color palette, using the colors from the logo â€” green, red and white.

I decided to apply a new font Lora because It is more modern.
I used a bold font for headings and a light version of the same font for text blocks to improve contrast through typography. 
The main titles use the largest font size to lead the viewer to read them first.
